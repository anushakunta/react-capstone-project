# Final E-Commerce Project - React

This project is a fully functional e-commerce platform designed to showcase key features commonly found in real-world online stores.

## Key Features

- **Navigation & Routing:**  
  Smooth navigation across various item categories using dynamic routing.

- **Product Catalog & Cart Functionality:**  
  Browse items by category and add them to a shopping cart.  
  The cart dynamically updates as items are added, removed, or their quantities are changed.

- **Checkout Process:**  
  Real-time updates on both the cart and checkout pages. Users can modify item quantities or remove items during checkout.

- **Stripe Payment Integration:**  
  A test version of the Stripe API is integrated to simulate payment processing.  
  Although no real transactions occur (as this is a portfolio project), the implementation closely mirrors a real-world setup.  
  Switching to live payments requires only a simple configuration change in Stripe.

- **Firebase Authentication & Storage:**  
  Firebase is used to manage user authentication and store essential data.  
  Users can:
  - Sign in with Google  
  - Sign up and sign in using an email and password

## Project Goals

This project aims to simulate the development of a professional-grade e-commerce application. By the end, you'll have hands-on experience with:

- Frontend routing and state management  
- Real-time UI updates  
- Secure user authentication  
- Payment processing integration
